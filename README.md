# Averaging EIS Spectral Data using EISPAC

This tutorial demonstrates how to average spectral data from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) instrument using the EISPAC package. It focuses on the Fe XII 195.12 Ã… line and covers the following topics:

1. Reading and fitting EIS data using EISPAC
2. Defining a region of interest for averaging
3. Creating a custom function to average spectral data within the defined region
4. Applying the averaging function to the EIS data
5. Analyzing and visualizing the averaged spectral data

## Requirements

To run this tutorial, you'll need the following packages installed:

- eispac
- astropy
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the tutorial repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed above.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `averaging_eis_spectral_data.ipynb` in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook).
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to learn how to average EIS spectral data using EISPAC.

## Data

The tutorial uses an example EIS data cube located at `/Users/andysh.to/Script/Python_Script/spice/comp_mosaic_2024/eis_20240327_224050.head.h5`. Make sure to replace this path with the correct location of your EIS data cube.
